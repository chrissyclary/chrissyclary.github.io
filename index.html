            <h3>I have two things to share. </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/?utm_expid=11945330-452.4qRuLuk_QjyPcd4iNmvIDw.0" title="Lucidcharts" target="new"><b>Lucidcharts</a>:</b> I love it! As I have a strange passion for the art of flowcharting I found the Lucidcharts product. We also use the product to build wireframes for application or web designs. It is a great tool for collaboration and it is easy to use. </p>

<p>My second thing is the <b>Art by Andrea Dorfman</b>. It is a fun little song that helps nudge me forward when my inner creative gets a little scared. </p>

              <h2>June 23 - 26: People card for Chrissy Clary</h2>
              <p>I started designing my people card by chatting with one of my classmates. I came up with a few ideas based on what she told me. I learned that she is an officer in the Coast Guard, she loves boats and she has a habit of buying too many floral print dresses. </p>
                               
<ul>
       <li>My first idea was to have a Palm Tree and an anchor added to the card once clicked on. Following the click, when you hovered over the card the tree and anchor would dance. </ol>
      <li>My second idea was to have her sitting in a boat once clicked. When you hover the boat would rock. </li>
                    <li>The final idea was to swap out the border of the card with a floral print when you click on the card.</li>
              </ul>
<h3>my sketches:</h3><img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T086L74T1-F1KAF0KLP/project_1_mockups_.jpg?pub_secret=d79cdb173d">
                

                <p>Unfortunately, she had to drop the course so I ended up doing my own card. I went with the last option as I too have an addiction to bohemian floral prints. </p>
