            <h2>July 5: My Project</h2>
             
             <p>At the end of the summer I hope to look back and know that I have made substantial progress toward reaching a goal I set for myself years ago. The goal is to start a web design business. Now I need to confess I will have a little (or a lot of help) in this, I am partnering with a web developer and, potentially, a salesman with an impressive record. </p>

<p>Over the summer the developer will help me pull together the website and other digital marketing collateral needed to begin our marketing efforts. I will design the concepts, ideas and brand. </p>

<p>Last week I dove in on an idea and started sketching out an interactive design survey and quickly lost track of the big picture. Molly and Shaunalynn helped pull me back up. This was important because it is easy to dive in on a fun, creative project that does not fit the big picture, this can be a real return on investment killer.</p>

<p>I have spent the weekend talking with my business partner and working to build a story map and brand identity for my company. The design survey project I referenced previously will work nicely with the business concept and brand and I expect I will use class and studio time to design the requirements to build it. I also hope to get the site map, design and content developed for my website. 
</p>
<p>So here is what I have so far:  </p>

<h3>Brand Identity </h3>

<p><b>Story Map:</b>I used a story map to help flesh out my brand and user journey </p><a href="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/story-map.jpg"><img src="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/story-map-little.jpg"></a>


<p><strong>Design Survey </strong>This design survey sketch will help guide the process as I pull together the elements and tech needed to make this work. </p><a href="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/design-survey.jpg"><img src="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/design-survey-little.jpg"></a>

             <h2>June 26: Cool digital things</h2>
            <h3>I have two things to share. </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/?utm_expid=11945330-452.4qRuLuk_QjyPcd4iNmvIDw.0" title="Lucidcharts" target="new"><b>Lucidcharts</a>:</b> I love it! As I have a strange passion for the art of flowcharting I found the Lucidcharts product. We also use the product to build wireframes for application or web designs. It is a great tool for collaboration and it is easy to use. </p>

<p>My second thing is the <b>Art by Andrea Dorfman</b>. It is a fun little song that helps nudge me forward when my inner creative gets a little scared. </p>

              <h2>June 23 - 26: People card for Chrissy Clary</h2>
              <p>I started designing my people card by chatting with one of my classmates. I came up with a few ideas based on what she told me. I learned that she is an officer in the Coast Guard, she loves boats and she has a habit of buying too many floral print dresses. </p>
                               
<ul>
       <li>My first idea was to have a Palm Tree and an anchor added to the card once clicked on. Following the click, when you hovered over the card the tree and anchor would dance. </ol>
      <li>My second idea was to have her sitting in a boat once clicked. When you hover the boat would rock. </li>
                    <li>The final idea was to swap out the border of the card with a floral print when you click on the card.</li>
              </ul>
<h3>my sketches:</h3><img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T086L74T1-F1KAF0KLP/project_1_mockups_.jpg?pub_secret=d79cdb173d">
                

                <p>Unfortunately, she had to drop the course so I ended up doing my own card. I went with the last option as I too have an addiction to bohemian floral prints. </p>
