            <h2>July 25: Focus</h2>
<p>I have lots of ideas in progress and feel like I am bubbling with creativity lately. I think my ideas have bounced around and I am at a point where it is time to focus a little more. I am also going to delegate some of the more highly technical aspects of this efforts. I am better and faster when I am strategizing and planning. 

<p>For much of my adult life I have been driven by the goals and needs of others. I think it is time to set my goals based on what I want in life. 

<p><b>So here is the life/work plan/goal:</b>
When my son graduates from high school – seven years from now – I plan to be a free agent. I plan to be running a thriving web design/digital marketing/consulting business focused on solving the digital problems of small business owners. I want to have the freedom to work from any place in the world. I wan the freedom to pick my clients based on mutual respect, creativity and flexibility. 

<p>I am in love with the idea of having a beautiful home base in Florida and spending summers traveling or living abroad while managing my business over via the digital network. I hope to mature my skills beyond my current position and become the recognized authority that small businesses turn to when they have questions about leveraging web technology to solve their business problems. 

<p>How do I get there? One day at a time. 

<p>I have the framework for my own small business set. The fledgling enterprise now has an official brand and small website. You can see it at <a href="www.bewellbedigital.com">BeWellBeDigital.com</a>. I believe the site and branding helps bring authority and credibility to the conversation I hope to start. 

<p>As far as where we go and how we grow, I want to understand better the tools small business owners can use to thrive online. I’ve come up with a lot of ideas for things I can do to help, but pretty much to this point I am really just guessing and making things up. I’m going to begin a journey focused on research. This research will help me hone in on common problems business owners face. Once problems are identified I will work to come up with solutions – sometimes I can monetize those solutions, and sometimes they will help me with my own content marketing efforts. One such item I am working in is an interactive design survey for small business owners. This tool will allow me to understand, over time, the design preferences and digital needs of small business owners. 

<p>In an effort to build my own brand authority I will research using my social communities and share my findings and research. 

<p>Here are my to-dos:  

<p>RESEARCH </p>
<ul><li>Goal: Find out what problems small businesses face when working in the digital a marketing place 
<li>Survey/interview small businesses </li>
<li> Look for good articles discussing the issues small businesses face  </li></li>
</ul>
<p>Content Marketing </p>
<ul>
<li> To Do by Aug 3 - send instructions/wireframes to developer to add blog feature to Be Well Be Digital Website </li>
<li> Weekly goal:
<li> Post one original blog post weekly on the be well be digital blog  </li>
<li>Share a minimum of 4 pieces of content </li>
<li> Work to add 10 new friends/followers to Be Well Be Digital Channels </li></li></ul>


<p>HELP AND SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY </p>

<p>Develop tools for use by the small business community </p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive Design Survey – recommends templates according to design preference and business need. - In progress: 
<li> Research user preference and classification for website designs – develop design survey by Aug 3. </li>
<li> Working to focus and identify the questions I need to ask   </li>
<li> Building wireframes and dataflow charts for use by developers – send to developer. </li></li>
<li>Idea: The Anatomy of a Great Home page 
<li> Needs more definition and verification. Need to make sure it is not always out there.  </li></li></ul>

            <h2>July 11: Progress</h2>
<p>Been making pretty good progress toward getting the site set up. My team decided that the Be Well Be Digital website should be as clean as possible. 

<p>We have been looking at themes to get a feel for what we collectively like. 
The <a href="http://www.motocms.com/website-templates/demo/51702.html">Mochito</a> and the <a href="http://www.wiselythemes.com/index.php?theme=mochito">Simplex</a> themes have qualities we like I expect the design will come together well.  

<p>I have also been working on the copy for the site. I don’t want to explain too much on our website. In researching other web design and digital marketing websites I am finding many of them to be heavy with content. I think this can cause a poor user experience, that is the last thing a web design firm should have in a site. I don’t want my customers to try and swim through pages and pages of fluff and crap, I want them to know what I do quickly and get the sense that I will help them solve their problems. 

<p><b>This is what I am thinking of starting with: </b>

            <h2>July 5: My Project</h2>
             
             <p>At the end of the summer I hope to look back and know that I have made substantial progress toward reaching a goal I set for myself years ago. The goal is to start a web design business. Now I need to confess I will have a little (or a lot of help) in this, I am partnering with a web developer and, potentially, a salesman both with an impressive record. </p>

<p>Over the summer the developer will help me pull together the website and other digital marketing collateral needed to begin our marketing efforts. I will design the concepts, ideas and brand. </p>

<p>Last week I dove in on an idea and started sketching out an interactive design survey and quickly lost track of the big picture. Molly and Shaunalynn helped pull me back up. This was important because it is easy to dive in on a fun, creative project that does not fit the big picture, this can be a real return on investment killer.</p>

<p>I have spent the weekend talking with my business partner and working to build a story map and brand identity for my company. The design survey project I referenced previously will work nicely with the business concept and brand and I expect I will use class and studio time to design the requirements to build it. I also hope to get the site map, design and content developed for my website. 
</p>
<p>So here is what I have so far:  </p>

<h3>Brand Identity </h3>

<p> A few sketches of things to come...</p>

<p><b>Story Map:</b>I used a story map to help flesh out my brand and user journey </p><a href="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/story-map.jpg"><img src="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/story-map-little.jpg"></a>


<p><strong>Design Survey </strong>This design survey sketch will help guide the process as I pull together the elements and tech needed to make this work. </p><a href="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/design-survey.jpg"><img src="http://chrissyclary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/design-survey-little.jpg"></a>

             <h2>June 26: Cool digital things</h2>
            <h3>I have two things to share. </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/?utm_expid=11945330-452.4qRuLuk_QjyPcd4iNmvIDw.0" title="Lucidcharts" target="new"><b>Lucidcharts</a>:</b> I love it! As I have a strange passion for the art of flowcharting I found the Lucidcharts product. We also use the product to build wireframes for application or web designs. It is a great tool for collaboration and it is easy to use. </p>

<p>My second thing is the <b>Art by Andrea Dorfman</b>. It is a fun little song that helps nudge me forward when my inner creative gets a little scared. </p>

              <h2>June 23 - 26: People card for Chrissy Clary</h2>
              <p>I started designing my people card by chatting with one of my classmates. I came up with a few ideas based on what she told me. I learned that she is an officer in the Coast Guard, she loves boats and she has a habit of buying too many floral print dresses. </p>
                               
<ul>
       <li>My first idea was to have a Palm Tree and an anchor added to the card once clicked on. Following the click, when you hovered over the card the tree and anchor would dance. </ol>
      <li>My second idea was to have her sitting in a boat once clicked. When you hover the boat would rock. </li>
                    <li>The final idea was to swap out the border of the card with a floral print when you click on the card.</li>
              </ul>
<h3>my sketches:</h3><img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T086L74T1-F1KAF0KLP/project_1_mockups_.jpg?pub_secret=d79cdb173d">
                

                <p>Unfortunately, she had to drop the course so I ended up doing my own card. I went with the last option as I too have an addiction to bohemian floral prints. </p>
